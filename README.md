#Photogram

App that allows users to upload pictures


Still in progress. Manual User Authentification instead of Devise. 
Must edit for users to see that they are logged in. 


Stuff to continue: 

* Allow users to tag other users in photos, Or instead use checkboxes to assign a user to a photo.
(check HABTM Checkboxes Railscast, check comments. Read Rails API documentation on collection_check_boxes, base helper documentation)

* Display a list of all the users in a drop-down menu when you add a tag to a photo.

* Create a profile page for a user (in user show page) that lists out all of the photos they're tagged in.

* Allow users "favorite" photos. On their profile page, include a list of all the photos they've favorited.

* Add a recommendation engine to users' profile page: based on the photos they've favorited and been tagged in, suggest other users for them to check out.
